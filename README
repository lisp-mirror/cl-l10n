0. About
cl-l10n is a localization package for common-lisp. It is meant 
to be serve the same purpose as Allegro Common Lisp's
various locale functions. It currently runs on 
CMUCL, SBCL, CLISP, ECL, Lispworks and Allegro CL although porting 
to a new implementation should be trivial.
It is distributed under an MIT style license although the locale
files themselves are distributed under the LGPL.
